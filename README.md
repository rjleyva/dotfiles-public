This is my personal macOS development environment, organized with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow). It
includes carefully curated configurations for Zsh, Git, tmux, and a manual LSP setup compatible with Neovim 0.11.3+.

This repo exists to keep my development environment consistent across machines and easy to replicate.

## What's Inside

- Lightweight, modular configurations for Neovim 0.11.3+, tmux, Zsh, and Git
- Practical utilities and workflow tweaks I use every day
- A modular design: use only what you need, swap components easily, or extend it to fit your workflow
